# **Verisense 2025 Year-End Roundup and 2026 Outlook**

### **2025: A Year of Growth and Milestones**

In 2025, Verisense completed a critical transition—from foundational L1 blockchain development to a chain-based application and early commercialization phase. Our active blockchain technology moved from theory to practice, becoming the underlying substrate for AI agents and the rapidly emerging agentic creator economy.

Verisense is now positioned not merely as infrastructure, but as a production-grade platform where agent behavior, coordination, and economic activity are natively on-chain.

## **1. Research and Thought Leadership**

In 2025, Verisense published its core whitepaper, introducing a novel paradigm: using blockchain as an immutable ledger for AI agents’ reputation, historical activity, and governance.

- [**Whitepaper**: _Verisense: An Active Blockchain for Agentic Systems_](https://github.com/verisense-network/papers/blob/main/whitepaper/verisense_whitepaper_20250426.pdf)

The paper formally defines Verisense as the world’s first **agentic blockchain**, structured around three foundational pillars:

1. **Agentic DID** – persistent, verifiable identities for AI agents
2. **Agentic Payment** – native economic rails enabling agents to transact autonomously
3. **Agentic Governance** – on-chain reputation, verifiability, accountability, and coordination mechanisms for agents

This work has shaped Verisense’s system design and informed external partners exploring decentralized agent standards.

## **2. Product Development**

Throughout 2025, Verisense delivered a full product stack spanning users, creators, and infrastructure.

### **Core Products**

- **Sense Space** A consumer-facing marketplace where users discover and interact with AI agents via natural language.
- **Sense Studio** A creator platform enabling agent developers to build, deploy, and host agents. Key capabilities include:

  - On-demand MCPs
  - Open LLM routers
  - Optimized agent hosting
  - Plug-and-play, pay-as-you-go pricing
- **Dashboard** An on-chain observability layer exposing agents, MCPs, and Nucleus (on-chain agents) running on Verisense.

### **Infrastructure Capabilities**

- Agentic Payment
- Agentic Commerce Platform
- Agent DID
- On-chain agent 

Together, these components form an end-to-end system for deploying economically active, verifiable AI agents.

## **3. Early Validation and Business Traction**

### **Agents and Agentic Assets**

- 274 registered and deployed agents
- 420 private “Homebrew” agents
- 58 MCPs deployed
- 12 Mini Apps live

### **Users and Creators**

- 500+ developers onboarded
- 250 creators with at least one agent submission
- 19.9K+ total users

### **System Metrics**

- 300K+ total agentic tasks completed
- 1.4M+ total platform visits

These metrics validate both developer demand and end-user appetite for agent-native applications.

## **4. Strategic Partnerships and Grants**

### **Mainstream Technology Partners**

- **Google** Selected for the top-tier grant of the Google Web3 Startup Program. Google recognizes Verisense as a critical extension of its Agent-to-Agent Communication Standard into decentralized environments, particularly through Verisense’s orchestration product line.
- **Stripe** Accepted into the Stripe Startup Program as an early customer for agentic payment infrastructure.
- **Amazon** Amazon (US) onboarded as the first agentic commerce platform. Additional integrations in progress include Alibaba Global, Temu, JD, and Pinduoduo.
- **Shopify** Partnering to support independent e-commerce sites; Shoppy integration is underway.

### **Web3 Ecosystem**

- **EigenLayer** – Grant recipient
- **World Foundation** – Verisense launched a [World Mini App campaign](https://x.com/veri_sense/status/1985703141837586504) in collaboration with World Foundation, expanding agent distribution channels.
- **Cambrian** - offers onchain data and risk analysis via Cambrian MCP in Sense Studio
- **Ambient** - offers decentralized LLM in Sense Studio to the Verisense global agent creator community.

## **5. Marketing, Events, and Community**
